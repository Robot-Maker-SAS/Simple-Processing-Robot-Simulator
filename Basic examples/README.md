# Basic examples
 Basic examples that you can use and modify to create your own robot simulator.

 BasicExample0:
 Simple simulator to move a simulated robot on a map with your keyboard.
 It is made for an azerty keyboard but can be easily modified. (it uses the keys a z e q s d)
 The example is based on the Eurobot / French robotic cup where the robot moves on a 3m x 2m map.
 In this example, the map is a 750 x 500 pixel image that represents the 3m x 2m map.
 
 BasicExample1:
 Simple simulator moving a robot on a map using data sent over serial port using simple ascii protocol.
 It also displays 200 lidar points. 
 A simple arduino code sending data (Robot position and 200 lidar points) is also provided.
 For this simple example to work you need to connect a serial com port device to your computer. 
 This processing example select the first serial com port available.
 You need to verify that the serial com port you want use is the first in the list.
